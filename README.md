## üì≤ Running the project

### ‚úîÔ∏è Pre-requisites

In order to be able to follow this README and run the project you may need the following items:
- Git to clone the project and access the branches. you can install [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads);
- Node so we can run `expo` and `npm`. you can install it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/);
- An Android or iOS cell phone with the Expo application installed, or an Android or iOS simulator on the computer;

If you want to test it, running the commands below separately should show the respective versions.

```
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

With `npm` installed we can install `expo` and check the version:
```
npm install --global expo-cli
expo --version
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the project

Now that you have the project folder on your machine, install the dependencies inside it:
```
npm install
```

Then we can run the project:
```
npm start
```

A browser tab will open, usually [this address](http://localhost:19002/).
If you have a cell phone, **scan the QR code with the Expo app** or the camera.
If your cell phone is on another network than the computer, change the "CONNECTION" to "Tunnel", and the app will be transmitted via the internet.
If you have a simulator, click on your simulator's operating system option in the left menu.

Okay, now the app you should see the app running.
